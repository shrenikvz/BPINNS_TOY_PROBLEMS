# Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Networks (BPINNs)

This repository contains the codes to assess the ability of B-PINNs in modeling some toy problems using noisy data.

## Toy problems considered

- Spring Mass Damper System

- 1D Steady State Heat Equation 

Different Measurement Noise Levels used in the training data.

- No Noise

- Low Noise (S: 0.001, $\omega_\text{cut,in}$: 3.14 rad/s, $\omega_\text{cut,off}$: 50 rad/s)

- High Noise (S: 0.01, $\omega_\text{cut,in}$: 3.14 rad/s, $\omega_\text{cut,off}$: 50 rad/s)
